To Do:

So I want to get an analysis of a collection of documents, sourceless statements I want to flag a level of authenticity for, and then I suppose it would be nice if I could take two statements and assign some metric of how implicative one statement is of another, and I could use that to help express convidence in the new statement. 



Maybe a really curated search engine (like if it has a lot of ads, it doesn’t make it into the results) Google Custom Search Engine? Or a way to say like “oh this doesn’t have a good reputation” could be crowdsourced, but not only that - to use this to filter results by reputation and relevance blended. idk
